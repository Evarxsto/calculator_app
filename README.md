# Simple Calculator App

### What is it?
This is a simple calculator app made to do easy calculations with both whole numbers and decimals.

### How was it made?
It was made with Python and Tkinter using Visual Studio Code.

### Why did I decide to make it?
I decided to make a simple calculator app to complete one of the challenges by INIT Hacks 2022.

### What were some things that I learned?
This was actually my first time using Tkinter and I was very excited to see a different tab open up with my calculator app on it.
I learned how to make my own GUI for the first time, and the syntax was very easy to understand. 

### What were some challenges that I ran into?
I wasn't too sure how to format the buttons so that they fit perfectly on the screen.
I tried playing around with the dimensions of the grid using root.geometry("wxh") but this didn't give me the result that I wanted.
I suspect that I need to change the dimensions of the buttons themselves to fit the grid, but this will need more research.
